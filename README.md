# Superlative Classification Platform

A CSV classification platform: upload and validate a dataset, choose a target
column, train a Random Forest pipeline, review metrics, and generate
predictions through a dynamic feature form.

## Repository layout

- `backend/` — Django REST API with a custom user model, developer registration
  and approval workflow, JWT authentication, CSV dataset validation, training,
  metrics, and prediction endpoints, plus PostgreSQL settings and environment
  templates.
- `frontend/` — React/Vite/Tailwind single-page app with protected
  authentication routing.
- `storage/` — filesystem boundary for datasets and trained model artifacts.
  Large files are not stored in PostgreSQL.
- `legacy-researchmind/` — the original ResearchMind multi-agent research
  system (LangChain web-search/report pipeline), kept intact. It does not run
  as part of this platform; see
  [`legacy-researchmind/README.md`](legacy-researchmind/README.md).

See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) and
[`frontend/README.md`](frontend/README.md) for setup commands.

Developer registration and approval are implemented, along with the CSV model,
dataset, training, metrics, and prediction workflow. Image classification remains
intentionally deferred.

## CSV workflow

1. Register and verify the developer email.
2. Sign in after a Super Admin approves the account.
3. Create a CSV classification model.
4. Upload and validate a CSV dataset.
5. Select and validate the target column.
6. Train the Random Forest pipeline.
7. Review accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and the confusion matrix.
8. Generate predictions through the dynamic feature form.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability reporting policy. CI runs
tests, Gitleaks scans repository history, CodeQL analyzes Python code, and
Dependabot monitors dependencies and Actions.
